<!-- This program demonstrates JavaScript inheritance using two classes: Car and Model.

Car class:

Has a constructor to set the car's brand (brand).
Includes a present() method that returns a message: "I have a [brand]".

Model class (inherits from Car):

Extends the Car class.
Its constructor accepts a name (brand) and a mod (model). It uses super(name) to call the Car class's constructor.
Includes a show() method that combines the brand and model into a message: "I have a [brand], it is a [model]".
Creates an object:

A Model object mycar is created with brand "Hundai" and model "Creta".
Displays the message:

The show() method of mycar generates the message:
"I have a Hundai, it is a Creta".
This is displayed on the webpage using document.write(). -->
